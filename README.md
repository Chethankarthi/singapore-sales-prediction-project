Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, and it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

Competitive Market: The resale flat market in Singapore is known for its competitiveness. Buyers and sellers often encounter challenges in accurately assessing the fair market value of a property due to the dynamic nature of the market and various influencing factors.

Complexity of Pricing: Determining the resale price of a flat involves considering numerous variables such as location, type of flat, floor area, lease duration, amenities, and market trends. These factors interact in complex ways, making it difficult for individuals to manually calculate an accurate resale price.

Data-Driven Solutions: With the availability of vast amounts of historical data on resale flat transactions, leveraging machine learning techniques becomes an effective approach. By analyzing this data, machine learning models can identify patterns and relationships between different features and the resale prices, enabling them to make predictions with a certain level of accuracy.

Empowering Buyers and Sellers: A predictive model empowers both potential buyers and sellers by providing them with a tool to estimate the resale value of a flat before entering negotiations or making purchase decisions. This information allows them to make more informed choices and better understand the market dynamics.

Efficiency and Accuracy: Compared to traditional methods of valuation, such as manual appraisal or relying solely on real estate agents' opinions, a machine learning model offers a more efficient and potentially more accurate means of estimating resale prices. It can process large volumes of data quickly and objectively, leading to more reliable predictions.

Accessibility: Deploying the predictive model as a user-friendly web application enhances its accessibility. Users can access the application from anywhere with an internet connection, enabling them to obtain resale price estimates conveniently and in real-time

Motivation:
The resale flat market in Singapore is highly competitive, and it can be challenging to accurately estimate the resale value of a flat. There are many factors that can affect resale prices, such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. A predictive model can help to overcome these challenges by providing users with an estimated resale price based on these factors.
